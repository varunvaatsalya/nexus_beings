# ðŸš¦ Traffic Management & Women Safety Detection System  

This project integrates **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** for traffic management and **MediaPipe** for gesture-based women safety detection. It is designed to efficiently monitor traffic violations and detect distress gestures to enhance safety measures.  

## âœ¨ Features  

### ðŸš¦ Traffic Management System  
- **Real-time Traffic Monitoring:** Uses YOLO to detect vehicles and identify traffic violations.  
- **Violation Detection:** Detects instances like signal jumping and unauthorized lane usage.  

### âœ‹ Women Safety Detection via Gesture Recognition  
- **Real-time Gesture Recognition:** Utilizes MediaPipe to detect predefined distress gestures.  
- **Emergency Alert System:** Can trigger alerts (SMS, alarm, or app notifications) when a distress gesture is recognized.  
- **Works in Various Environments:** Adaptable to different lighting and camera angles.  

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used  
- **YOLO** for real-time object detection  
- **MediaPipe** for human pose and gesture recognition  
- **OpenCV** for image processing  
- **Python** for backend processing  
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch** *(if used for additional ML-based improvements)*  

## ðŸš€ Installation  

**Clone the repository**
